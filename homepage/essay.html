            "The F Train"

        </h2>
        <h2>
            All cities, towns and villages experience cycles. people wake up, do their daily business have their meals, have their social time, and go to sleep. But when you have eight million people of all different cultures and backgrounds compressed into one city, the cycles become more pronounced, but at the same time the changes are more blended into each other. It comes down to morning vs afternoon, day vs night. New York at night and New York in the day are two different cities. Like many aspects of New York, this is embodied in the transit system, for me specifically, the F train. The morning train will often have an energy of frustration and grogginess as hundreds of people cram themselves into each car. It isn’t rare that I have to push my way into the train car, it feels wrong, but it’s what must be done. Then I stand there, even though there might be upwards of two hundred people in a space smaller than an apartment it’s almost dead silent. The early afternoon train is different, it’s not quite rush hour, but there are still lots of people, instead of frustration, the train has an aura of exhaustion but pleasantness. The day is over, and the ride is relaxing, a sense of relief. I ride chat with friends and look forward to being able to unwind at home ten stops away. It isn't long however before my alarm is ringing the next day and it’s time to push my way into the f train again. It’s almost identical to the day before, maybe five minutes earlier, maybe five minutes later, the train looks the same, but almost everyone is different. You could take the same train everyday for twenty years and still see mostly new people everyday.

        </h2>
        <h2>
            The f train in the day is for commuters, and when not in pandemic times, tourists. People chat, sleep or read; there is commotion, there are things happening, it’s busy. On the day train it feels like you're in a crowd; everyone’s doing their own thing, and you’re just one of many. eight hours later, and suddenly you’ve stepped into an alternate dimension, it’s like something out of the twilight zone. What felt busy and overwhelming before feels lonely and peaceful now. The stations along the f route, especially the hubs like rockefeller center and bryant park, which are centers of tourism and business, feel eerily quiet.

        </h2>
        <h2>
            The f train is widely considered one of the best trains (i think) because of its route. It starts in deep queens, makes its way through all of the queens; then it crosses the river, even stopping where I live: Roosevelt Island. Once it has crossed the river, it goes through all of midtown, then curves left, going through lower manhattan and finally banking into brooklyn. The result is that over the course of the route you see many different kinds of people come and go, more so than other trains. When I get on it’s mostly the laid back relaxed queens people, but as the train keeps going more and more goofy manhattan types board, until they’ve completely replaced the queens people. The train’s vibe fluctuates and changes, taking on the personality of the neighborhood it currently finds itself in.

        </h2>
        <h2>
            People who don't live in a place as big and complex as New York might find it baffling that another neighborhood or borough can feel completely foreign and alien, even if it’s in the same city you’ve lived in your entire life. The trains can often be the embodiment of this sentiment, the train is your life line, everyone has the one or two train lines they know will take them home, if they can find that train they can find home. Even though the trains mostly look the same, one train can feel like it’s taking you away from comfort, away from home, while another can feel like home in itself, an extension of your neighborhood.

        </h2>
        <h2>
            New York is a busy place, there is a lot of stuff going on, some people new to the city can find it overwhelming. People moving in from small towns might long for quiet peaceful life, but really, people considering moving to NYC might be turned away for the same reason. But peace is where you make it, it’s a state of mind, and in the right moments you can find it the busiest and most overwhelming of places. One of these unlikely places for me is the subway, specifically the f train. I have grown so familiar that I don't have to look at anymap or pay full attention to know where I am. Especially later in the day, when things settle down, it can be easy to forget that you're only one of many on the train and instead you look inwards and entertain yourself with reflection of your inner thoughts and complexities. On the other hand you can download tv show episodes and still relax and find relative peace; what it comes down to is if you’re looking for peace, and you are in the right mood, the train is as good a setting as any.
